                        &emsp; Hi babi, before anything else, I just want to say Happy 1st Monthsary to us! Thank you for being here with me I still can't believe we ended up falling for each other. Parang kelan lang, I was ranting and crying to you, and now, here we are, happily celebrating our first month as an official couple.</span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  These past weeks, you've truly shown how loving, caring, and responsible you are as a partner, and I appreciate you so much, babi. Thank you for being you. I love you so much, and I hope our first month turns into a first anniversary‚Äîand many more beautiful memories together.

Always know that I‚Äôm here, not just as your partner, but also as your friend and even your enemy (kung kinakailangan, haha). You can always count on me through the ups and downs. We‚Äôll make this relationship work, love, until we both achieve success. I love you so much. Happy Monthsary!</span>
